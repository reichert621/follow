# Getting started

### Install dependencies

- Install **Node v8.x** and **npm v5.x** if you haven't already ([nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [n](https://github.com/tj/n) are create tools for this)
- Next, install the dependencies from `package.json` with
  ```
  $ npm install
  ```
- To keep things easy, install a few global dependencies:
  ```
  $ npm install -g webpack knex
  ```

### Set up a local Postgres database

- Install Postgres if you haven't already (see [Installing Postgres via Brew](https://gist.github.com/sgnl/609557ebacd3378f3b72))
- Optional: Install a Postgres client (see [Postico](https://eggerapps.at/postico/) or [PSequel](http://www.psequel.com/))
- Create a database (this will be your `$FOLLOW_DB_NAME` environment variable)
  - Or in SQL, with `psql -c CREATE DATABASE [insert_dev_db_name_here];`
  - This can either be done with `createdb [insert_dev_db_name_here]`
- Optional: Test your database credentials by connecting to the newly created database in your Postgres client
- Using these credentials, add your database environment variables to your `~/.bash_profile`, or wherever you store them. This is required for the [`knexfile.js`](https://github.com/reichert621/follow/blob/master/server/db/knexfile.js)
- Set your `$NODE_ENV` environment variable to `dev`, so that the `knexfile` knows which configuration to use

For reference, my local environment variables look like this in my `~/.bash_profile` file:
```
  # Node environment
  export NODE_ENV='dev'

  # DB credentials
  export FOLLOW_DB_PORT=5432
  export FOLLOW_DB_HOST='localhost'
  export FOLLOW_DB_NAME='follow' # this should match the db you created above
  export FOLLOW_DB_USER=''
  export FOLLOW_DB_PW=''
```

### Run the app

Migrate the database, build the client, and run the server:
```
$ npm start
```
which is the same as:
```
$ npm run db:migrate              # Ensures the db is up to date with latest migrations
$ npm run build                   # Builds the React client
$ node server/index.js            # Runs the Node/Express server
```

Go to `localhost:8000` (or whatever `$PORT` you set) to check that the app is running.

### Development

To simply start the server, run:
```
$ npm run dev
```

This will serve the contents of the `client/build` directory, which are built with Webpack.

To run Webpack in `--watch` mode, run:
```
$ npm run watch
```

And that should be it! Happy hacking ðŸ¤“
